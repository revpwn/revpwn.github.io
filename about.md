Hello! My name is Austin Tice, but online I go by rooted. I work as an intern security researcher for the DOE. Currently I am finishing my master's degree in Cybersecurity at Tennessee Tech University. As you can imagine that's quite busy, but I try to always make time for CTF. I play with [Samurai](https://ctftime.org/team/1937/), but also often just play solo and solve challenges that seem interesting.

My main interests, if you hadn't already guessed from my domain name, are reverse engineering and binary exploitation.

If you have any questions/inquiries or just want to CTF definitely reach out to me on discord `rooted#5644` or via email `roootedshell@gmail.com`

Cheers
